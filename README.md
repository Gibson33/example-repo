Practical Task 3: hello_world.js

This repo represents a program that prints "Hello World!" to the console. It has been copied to this Git Repo from the previous task's repo (Practical Task 2), to demonstrate linking code to new repositories.
It serves as an introduction to basic JavaScript and Git version control.
