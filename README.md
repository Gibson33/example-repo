# example-repo: Vestiti Viral Sneaker Store

This project is a basic sneaker store webpage created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

The page includes:

- A title section introducing the brand "Vestiti Viral"
- A responsive layout that displays sneaker products in rows
- Each product has an image, name, price, and a "BUY" button
- A footer section with a contact form and the brand logo

Styling is handled using Bootstrap classes for layout, spacing, and responsiveness, with some additional custom CSS for fonts, hover effects, and button colors.

All images used are AI-generated and stored in the `shoes` folder.
